INSTALLATION (on Unix)

Installation is as per the standard module installation approach:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install




INSTALLATION (on Windows: ActiveState Perl, or IndigoPerl, and NMAKE)

Another way to install as a traditional Perl module, using
"perl Makefile.PL" and Microsoft's NMAKE, included with
MS DevStudio. Here's what one user has to say on this subject:

    nmake works nicely, and the installation process looks the same
    as on other platforms.

    My understanding is that nmake.exe is available for free from
    Redmond. In fact I downloaded it just a few minutes ago,
    following the suggestion found on the IndigoPerl home page:

      Installing CPAN modules requires that you have Microsoft
      DevStudio or nmake.exe installed.  If you are installing
      modules that contain xs files, then you need DevStudio,
      otherwise you only need nmake.exe.  You can download
      nmake from [the url below].

      Run the self-extracting exe and copy nmake.exe to the perl\bin
      directory.

[the URL is:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe
]

    Nmake15.exe expands to nmake.exe (64K) and Nmake.Err (5k) - a text
    file.  I copied both to C:\perl\bin, then renamed nmake.exe to
    make.exe and now I can pretend to be on Unix:

        H:\devperl\some-module>perl Makefile.PL
        Writing Makefile for some-module

        H:\devperl\some-module>make all test

        H:\devperl\some-module>make install
        ...
