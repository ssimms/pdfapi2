PDF::API2 is using Dist::Zilla to make development easier.
Unfortunately, this can make it a little bit harder to contribute
since the source isn't the same as the distribution.


GET THE SOURCE CODE
-------------------

You can get the source from the following master repository:

http://deefs.net/hg/pdfapi2

It can also be found in an easily-forked location at:

http://bitbucket.org/ssimms/pdfapi2


INSTALL Dist::Zilla
-------------------

Once you have the source, you'll also need the Dist::Zilla
distribution from CPAN.  It has a boatload of dependencies, but it
should install cleanly.  If not, help is usually easy to find on
irc.perl.org.


RUN dzil build|test|etc
-----------------------

PERL5LIB=lib dzil build|test|etc

or

export PERL5LIB=lib
dzil build|test|etc

If you leave out the PERL5LIB=lib part, you'll almost definitely get
an error saying that PDF::API2::Build::Version couldn't be located.
That's because it's only found here.

Basically, PDF::API2::Build::Version takes the version number from the
dist.ini file and adds it to all the .pm files just under the package
name.  As of this writing, I haven't found a plugin for Dist::Zilla
that does this in a way that doesn't look machine-generated.
