2.040     2021-04-13

    - Fix open() followed by stringify() resulting in a corrupt (mostly-empty)
      PDF, which was broken by changes in 2.039 (reported by Gareth Tunley).

    - [RT #134993] Calling open($filename) followed by saveas($same_filename)
      instead of update() resulted in a corrupt PDF in 2.039, which no longer
      reads the entire file into memory on open (reported by Marco Pessotto).

    - [RT #134957] Fix encoding of \n in a PDF string containing non-printable
      characters (reported by Stuart Henderson).

    - [RT #133131] Fix endianness of 64-bit numbers in cross-reference stream
      widths array (reported by Christopher Papademetrious, fix by Vadim Repin).


2.039     2021-03-04

    - PDF::API2->open($filename) no longer reads the entire file into memory
      before working on it, instead reading from the file as needed.  This
      results in a substantial reduction in memory usage and start-up time for
      large PDF files, particularly in cases where the calling script doesn't
      need to access all of the contents of the PDF.

    - PDF files containing cross-reference streams can now be modified and saved
      normally.  Previously, they were read-only.

    - $text->paragraph(...) and $text->paragraphs(...) (formerly "section") are
      no longer undocumented and experimental.  If you were previously using
      them at your own risk, note that "-spillover" is no longer an option (text
      will always wrap inside the specified width if possible).  In addition,
      paragraphs(...) no longer collapses consecutive newlines.

    - [RT #98546] There is now an -align-last option for justified text to
      specify how the final line should be justified.  Left is still the
      default.

    - Code in the PDF::API2::Basic::PDF namespace was originally licensed under
      the Perl Artistic License, which has been determined to not be
      (L)GPL-compatible.  Martin Hosken has graciously granted an MIT license
      for use of his code contained in PDF::API2, so the distribution may now be
      used solely under the terms of the LGPL rather than requiring both
      licenses simultaneously.  Many thanks to Petr Pisar for his help in
      working through the licensing issues.

    - Renamed $text->lead(...) to $text->leading(...).  The old name is
      deprecated but will continue to work.  If you're modifying PDF::API2
      objects by editing their hash values instead of using these accessors,
      you'll need to update your code.

    - Added a -compress option (on by default) to PDF::API2->new(), open(), and
      open_scalar().  If disabled, most streams won't be compressed, which can
      simplify debugging.


2.038     2020-08-31

    - Use PDF::API2::XS or Image::PNG::Libpng, if either is installed, to speed
      up inclusion of PNG files with an alpha channel by an order of magnitude
      (written by Rob Scovell, sponsored by prayerletters.com).


2.037     2020-02-05

    - Allow PDF 2.0 files to be opened.

    - [RT #131147] Ignore dictionary entries with null values (reported by Klaus
      Ethgen, fix by Vadim Repin).


2.036     2019-09-17

    - Eliminate another uninitialized value warning in BaseFont.pm.


2.035     2019-08-09

    - The bounding box methods (mediabox, cropbox, bleedbox, trimbox, and
      artbox) now return their values when called without arguments.

    - The get_[media|crop|bleed|trim|art]box page methods have been deprecated
      since they're now redundant, but they continue to work.

    - [RT #130074] Remove unneeded (and newly-broken) calls to is_utf8 in
      Annotation.pm and NamedDestination.pm (reported by Mathieu Arnold).

    - Eliminate some uninitialized value warnings in BaseFont.pm.


2.034    2019-06-29

    - SUPPORTED PERL VERSIONS: Starting with this release, PDF::API2 will
      support major Perl versions released in the past six years, plus the major
      release before that one.  This should provide backward compatibility for
      the life of most LTS server distributions, while eliminating the need to
      troubleshoot warnings and bugs that only show up in increasingly-ancient
      versions of Perl.

      For this release, it means that the minimum supported Perl is 5.18, which
      was first released on 2013-05-18.

    - Add support for cross-reference streams using 64-bit field widths.

    - When the utf8 flag is set for a PDF string, automatically encode it as
      UCS-16BE instead of requiring a separate flag to be set in the PDF object.
      This resolves [RT #33497] and [RT #117031] in addition to making the code
      easier to maintain.

    - [RT #126274] Fix alignment when using UniFont with text_center or
      text_right when all characters are in the same block.

    - [RT #121911] Fix adding pages to a document structure with nested Pages
      elements.  This included a fairly substantial rewrite of the relevant
      code, so please report any new bugs related to adding pages (report and
      troubleshooting by Vadim Repin).

    - Renamed pdfile() to pdf_file() in PDF::API2::Annotation and
      PDF::API2::Outline.  The old name continues to work, but is deprecated.


2.033     2017-07-06

    - [RT #122371] Remove a couple of improperly-placed weaken statements
      (reported by Phil Perry).

    - [RT #122372] Fix weakening when a page is added to the end of a multiple
      page document (reported by Phil Perry).

    - Fix Bank Gothic core font (reported by Phil Perry).


2.032     2017-07-02

    - PDF::API2 has many circular references, and the end() method doesn't clear
      them all, so memory is leaked.  This release uses Scalar::Util's weaken()
      function to improve garbage collection.  A significant number of circular
      references have been weakened, though many likely still remain.

    - [RT #120756] Eliminate a warning for an ambiguous call to CORE::open
      (first reported by Abdelbaki Brahmia).

    - $text->text_justified() and $text->text_fill_justified() now adjust the
      space between words rather than stretching individual characters in order
      to get the text to fit.

    - [RT #120397] Indirect references and indirect objects can have comments
      embedded in their whitespace, and their object number and generation may
      be split across multiple lines, which may not all be buffered (reported by
      SPROUT).

    - [RT #120450] Fix PDF::API2->open($filename)->stringify() (reported by
      SPROUT).

    - Fix an off-by-one error when calculating text width while charspace is
      non-zero.

    - [RT #120048] Fix PDF::API2->synfont() (broken in 2.029, fixed by Vadim
      Repin) and add basic testing.


2.031     2017-01-26

    - Fix use of cache files when reading streams: temp files will now be used
      any time a stream is larger than 16MB (by default).  Formerly, due to a
      bug, they would only be created when a 4kB chunk of a stream increased to
      16kB or more after being decompressed.

    - Numbers, booleans, and null values can now be read from object streams.

    - Update to [RT #113290]: Objects inside a large object stream are now read
      without loading the entire object stream into memory.

    - DEPRECATION: The low-level new_api methods have been deprecated in favor
      of calling new directly.  If your code uses new_api($api2, ...), replace
      it with new($api2->{'pdf'}, ...).

    - [RT #118352] Don't crash when adding an annotation to a page that has an
      existing annotations array stored as an indirect object (reported by Johan
      Vromans).

    - [RT #118717] Die with an informative error if a file can't be opened
      during open() or saveas() (reported by Johan Vromans).


2.030     2016-10-13

    - Fix a font naming issue introduced while satisfying Perl::Critic.


2.029     2016-10-10

    - [RT #113293] Files with cross-reference streams weren't correctly setting
      the max object number (report and troubleshooting by Marco Pessotto).

    - Handle TIFF images with strips that are wider than the image (report and
      patch by Jeffrey Ratcliffe).

    - [RT #98574] Increase test coverage of PDF::API2::Content (tests by Phil
      Perry).

    - A bunch of code cleanup and documentation updates by Paul Cochrane.

    - Add a missing prereq on Win32 systems (patch by Michiel Beijen).

    - [RT #113514, #98552] Fix the dash() and renderingintent() methods in
      ExtGState (reported by Vadim Repin and Phil Perry).

    - Satisfy all Perl::Critic severity 5 policies.

    - [RT #117940] Allow PNG, GIF, and PNM files to be opened from filehandles
      in addition to filenames (patch by Johan Vromans).

    - [RT #33970] Fail fast when a referenced file can't be opened (requested by
      Barrie Slaymaker a mere 8.5 years ago).

    - Add -simplex, -duplexfliplongedge and -duplexflipshortedge as options to
      $pdf->preferences() (requested by Doug Poulin).


2.028     2016-06-08

    - [RT #113290] Fix for reading objects inside an object stream in a large
      PDF (patch by Marco Pessotto).

    - Eliminate an infinite loop when reading a corrupt dictionary.


2.027     2016-03-11

    - This release contains seven fixes for parsing PDFs.  They mostly affect
      files using cross-reference streams, which were first supported in the
      previous release.  Thanks to Marco Pessotto and Stuart Henderson for their
      help identifying and troubleshooting bugs.

    - Added contrib/pdf-debug.pl to help track down issues related to opening
      and parsing PDFs.


2.026     2016-02-24

    - [RT #48683] Add support for PDFs with cross-reference streams and object
      streams (patch by Don Huettl of Grant Street Group).

    - [RT #107333] Accept an empty string as a valid Name, per PDF spec 1.7
      section 7.3.5 (patch by Mark Balitsky).

    - [RT #98551] Rename aliases 2A, 4A, 2B, and 4B to 2A0, 4A0, 2B0, and 4B0.
      The old names will continue to work, but are now undocumented (patch by
      Phil Perry).

    - Add -mils and -color as options for barcodes.  Reset linedash so that
      barcodes are always solid lines (patch by Erelen).

    - [RT #98549] Rename meterlimit to miterlimit (patch by Phil Perry).

    - [RT #98534] Rename hspace to hscale (patch by Phil Perry).

    - Fixed an infinite loop when RunLengthDecode is used for output.

    - [RT #65582] Fix embedding of OpenType fonts (fix by Simon Cozens).

    - [RT #67767] Allow an empty page to be imported into a PDF using
      importPageIntoForm (reported by Antti Lankila).

    - [RT #66341] Various fixes for ASCII85Decode and LZWDecode.


2.025     2015-09-23

    - The previous release included a patch that broke compatibility with Perl
      5.8.x.  The minimum supported version is now Perl 5.8.5, and there is a
      .perl-version file to facilitate testing using plenv.


2.024     2015-09-18

    - [RT #104133] Include all bounding boxes when importing a page (patch by
      Don Huettl of Grant Street Group).

    - [RT #104133] When retrieving bounding boxes for a page, fall back
      according to the defaults listed in the PDF spec (patch by Don Huettl of
      Grant Street Group).

    - Barcodes now take an optional -caption argument that will be printed
      beneath the barcode.  This can replace or be used in conjunction with the
      text representation of the barcode (requested by Gareth Tunley).

    - [RT #105581] Calls to width() in BaseFont are now significantly faster
      (patch by Dmitri Tikhonov).


2.023     2014-09-12

    - The fix for [RT #69503] broke a previously-working case where a page
      object could be passed (and was expected).  The -firstpage option now
      accepts a page object or a page number.  Thanks to Marco Pessotto for the
      bug report and test.


2.022     2014-07-04

    - Added $pdf->version() get/set method.  When opening an existing PDF, the
      existing version number will now be retained.

    - Renamed the following in PDF::API2:
        - importpage to import_page
        - openScalar to open_scalar

      The old names are deprecated.

    - [RT #69503] Fix the -firstpage option to $pdf->preferences() so that it
      doesn't always lead to a crash (reported by Dietrich Streifert).

    - [RT #47974] Accept malformed xref subsections (with a warning) that have
      extraneous spaces on the first line (reported by Abhinav Kaushik).

    - [RT #94505] For Code128 barcodes, the initial character set is now
      optional (defaults to B or C depending on the content to be encoded).  The
      initial character set can be passed as a capital letter, and the program
      will die if an invalid character set is requested (requested by Andrea
      Nall).

    - Interleaved 2 of 5 barcodes now prepend a zero when an odd number of
      digits is specified, which is standard behavior.  Previously, a zero was
      appended instead.

    - $page->rotate(0) now sets rotation to 0 degrees rather than deleting an
      existing page rotation command.  Page rotation is inherited, so this is
      necessary to undo any inherited page rotation.

    - Fix: Attempts to use EAN-128 barcodes resulted in an error.

    - Add a more informative error when text() is called without first setting a
      font(), and when font() is called without including a font size.


2.021     2014-02-20

    - Fixed numerous bugs in the string parsing code, including the one reported
      in [RT #63918] by Frank Doepper.

    - [RT #41049] Rewrote literal string parsing to prevent a stack overflow due
      to an inefficient regex (reported by Sergei Fetisov).

    - [RT #91822] Fix compression of GIF images to ensure that output codes
      don't exceed 12 bits (reported by Vadim Repin).

    - The RunLengthDecode filter didn't actually work.  Its code has been
      rewritten and now passes basic encoding and decoding tests.

    - Fix Code128 barcode switching from Code C to Code B in certain cases
      (reported by Doru Petrescu).


2.020     2013-01-20

    - Give a more informative error message when a PDF file using a
      cross-reference stream is encountered.  The Known Issues section of the
      documentation includes pointers on how to add support in case someone else
      can get to this before I do.

    - Text using TrueType fonts is now searchable again.  In version 0.61, an
      undocumented -unicodemap option was added to nearly all of the font
      resource methods, which only included a ToUnicode CMap if it was set (and
      it's required in order for PDF readers to be able to identify individual
      characters if BaseEncoding isn't present, which it isn't for TrueType
      fonts).

      I've left the -unicodemap option in place, and it's still undocumented
      (except here), but it's now on by default.  Call $pdf->ttfont($fontfile,
      -unicodemap => 0) if you want to disable it for performance or file size
      reasons.

    - Add a note to the stringify method's documentation saying that it's a
      destructive operation.

    - The various filter types have their own classes in the
      PDF::API2::Basic::PDF::Filter namespace now, rather than having all of the
      packages in Filter.pm.

    - To facilitate testing and ensure that identically-generated PDFs have
      identical output in Perl 5.17.5 or later, PDF dictionary keys are now
      sorted during output.


2.019     2011-03-10

    - [RT #66167] Fix a typo in the require statement for code128 barcodes (TC
      Kuan).

    - Numerous modules are now only loaded when they're needed, which should
      help speed up the load time and reduce the memory footprint.

    - Test coverage is up to about 45% of the codebase.


2.018     2011-02-23

    - The tests in 2.017 exposed a floating point issue where some computers
      give more trailing zeros than others.  It doesn't affect the output, but
      it does break the tests on those computers, since the PDFs are slightly
      different.  This version modifies the float() method to remove trailing
      zeros, which should fix the test breakage and give consistent PDFs.


2.017     2011-02-22

    - The DejaVu fonts have been removed from the distribution, since they were
      only used by one example script.  If you need them for your project, you
      can download them from http://dejavu-fonts.org

    - Fix: Content->bogen() didn't behave as documented if $move was set (it
      started drawing from the center of the circle rather than [x1, y1]).

    - The undocumented nettfont method has been removed, along with the
      supporting PDF::API2::Resource::Font::neTrueType module.

    - The undocumented save_xml method has been removed, along with the
      supporting functions in PDF::API2::Basic::*.

    - The undocumented textstate2 method has been removed from
      PDF::API2::Content.

    - [RT #58386] Fix create_egs call in Lite.pm (J Greely)

    - [RT #62922] Fix string interpolation in pdf-merge.pl (Guillaume Rousse and
      Jerome Quelin)

    - [RT #65458] Fix an error in the synopsis (Frank Ammeter)

    - [RT #66054] Fix rename of .cmap files so that they actually work
      now. (cnhacktnt)

    - The test suite has grown to nearly 200 tests, covering about 40% of the
      codebase.  There's still plenty of room for improvement.


2.016     2011-01-24

    - New Maintainer: Steve Simms (http://deefs.net)

    - This release jumps from version 0.73 to 2.016 in order to provide a
      consistent version number across all modules in the distribution without
      breaking any existing code or going backwards.

    - Lots of updates to the documentation, particularly in PDF::API2::Content,
      which was almost completely rewritten and reorganized.

    - Font::TTF has been added as a dependency instead of being embedded in the
      distribution.

    - Everything that worked in 0.73 should work unmodified in 2.016, at least
      if it used the published documentation, and most everything should still
      work even if it didn't.

    - PDF::API2 used to read and parse three text files, one of which was over
      500kB, on every load.  These files have been turned into modules, and
      while I haven't done any performance testing, I'd have a hard time
      believing that it isn't faster now.

    - There are now a few tests forming the beginning of a test suite.
      Contributions of tests would be most welcome!
