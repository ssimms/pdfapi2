=head1 FONTS AND TYPESETTING

=head1 INTEROPERABLILITIES


=head2 Adobe Reader & Acrobat (Windows)

The Acrobat/Adobe Reader will open and print files created with PDF::API2,
but sometimes Acrobat (Full Product) will be unable to edit/update them.

=head3 Adobe Reader (Linux)

Since the MS Core Fonts may not be available via X11, those corefonts may
either look/print odd or may be entirely missing (dependent on installation).


=head2 Macromedia Freehand (Windows)

Any version of Freehand is unable to open files either created or updated by PDF::API2.
Redestilled files do work, but embedded fonts are missing, which is probably bug in
Freehand's pdf engine.


=head2 Ghostscript

Versions before 7.03 had problems reading PDF::API2 created pdfs.

PDF::API2 versions prior to 0.30_7x embedded Type1 Fonts not
digestible by gs.

=head3 Redmon / FreePDF (Windows)

Since these are based on ghostscript, they can be used to redistill 
pdfs from and to PDF::API2.


=head2 Xpdf

Xpdf and tools need to be compiled with both freetype2 and libT1.

pdftops produces problematic ps-files if the pdf-file created via PDF::API2 
contains embedded CFF (aka. Opentype) fonts.


=head2 pdftk

pdftk is a nice tool to pre/post-process pdf-files. 

Version 0.91 does not support big-endian unicode metadata as
PDF::API2 does use as default.


=head2 Jaws PDF

Some versions of this software (5D PDF Creator) create pdfs not consumable
by PDF::API2 (if you just need a pdf-printer driver use FreePDF).


=head2 Omnipage

PDF::API2 versions prior to 0.40_17 had a bug that screws up omnipages
unfortunate image name-keys and lzw-encoded page descriptions. 


=head2 Open Office

PDF::API2 versions prior to 0.40_xx had a bug that screws up colorspaces 
of indexed images during import/save.
